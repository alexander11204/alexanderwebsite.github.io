	<p>Strengths:
The site is easy to navigate around, with a common theme that has the exact same navigation bar on the top of the website meaning that the website is interactive and easy to navigate around. <br><br>
The website uses hyperlinks effectively to allow the user to correctly navigate around the website and onto external sites (such as the companies twitter page)
Multimedia is quickly loaded, through the use of CSS the multimedia is shown on the website. The text used on all the web pages is in a font style, colour and size that makes it easy for the user to read, with the most important text usually being in the middle of the website. <br><br>
The website displays the products to the user easily as the site is easy to navigate around, the site is colourful to look at which keeps the user interested and more likely to continue shopping within the site. The site visuals draw attention to the product the company is trying to sell to the customer. <br><br>
The site follows web standards, the web page is displayed correctly on a variety of browsers and computers this is needed as customers will not be using the same software and the website needs to be viewable to everyone.<br><br>
The website can easily be maintained and edited as there is only one style sheet which affects the whole website, the html pages link to this style sheet meaning maintenance of the website is easy.<br><br>
The website only has one style sheet which means the website is loaded quicker than an individual style sheet for every HTML page.<br><br>
The images used within the website for the multimedia is in the form of JPG, which means the images load quickly and use less bandwidth than higher quality images.
The text within the website has been checked for grammatical and spelling errors and it has been found that the website is easy to read and understand by the user this is a good thing as it should be understandable.<br><br><br>

Weaknesses:
There is no interactive way for the user to buy products and get it delivered to there house via a checkout system, such a way should be implemented in the future as it would allow the website to be used as a store to quickly and easily buy products.<br><br>
The interaction within the website is limited, and there is no advanced javascript funcationity this is a let down for the website and is something that should be added in the future<br><br>

The website does not use geolocation features, this should be implemented in the future as an easy way to find the closet store and give the user directions.
There could be another css sheet for the user to change between, this could be useful for users with dyslexia to chose to use the website and thus find it easier to read.
There is no mobile version of the website, in the future the website should be able to detect if the user is using a mobile device to access the content and change the website over to a version that is easier to use on a mobile device.
